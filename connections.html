        <h3>Text-to-Text Connection</h3>
        <p><em>Zero to One</em> and <strong>Ray Bradbury’s “The Pedestrian”</strong> both highlight the importance of thinking independently. While Thiel motivates creativity and breaking away from competition, he also critiques a society that punishes those who walk their own path. Both texts try to convince readers to resist staying in one place and challenge the status quo.</p>

        <h3>Text-to-Self Connection</h3>
        <p>Reading <em>Zero to One</em> made me reflect on how I see challenges. I’ve often played it safe when starting something new, but Thiel’s belief creatiity and starting something new inspired me to take more creative risks. His idea of uncovering “secrets” made me realize how many opportunities I might be missing by only following what others are doing.</p>

      <div class="connection-section card">
        <h3>Text-to-World Connection</h3>
        <p><em>Zero to One</em> connects to current global trends in tech entrepreneurship. As AI, biotech, and climate tech create new things, Thiel’s message about building the future reflects in this heavily. His ideas challenge not only businesses, but entire nations, to think ahead and create lasting change rather than competing in saturated spaces.</p>
